# Homework 7

## Exercise 1 5 points
3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D-GAN) generates 3D objects from a
probabilistic space by leveraging recent advances in volumetric convolutional
networks and generative adversarial nets.
1. Read and summarize the paper “Learning a Probabilistic Latent Space of
Object Shapes via 3D Generative-Adversarial Modeling” and familiarize
yourself with 3D-GAN (http://3dgan.csail.mit.edu/).
2. Setup 3D-GAN by following the installation instructions on the website. Since
training 3D-GAN requires huge computing resources, use pretrained model
provided along with the code.
3. Generate 10 different kinds of cars from the pretrained model. Report your
results.

## Exercise 2 5 points
As can be seen from the previous exercise, many of the generated models are not of
good quality.
1. Enlist various reasons as to why the visual quality of generated 3D designs is
not as good as the manually designed 3D designs.
2. Read and summarize “Automated Learning of User Preferences for Selection
of High-Quality 3D Designs” provided along with this homework. This paper
essentially focuses on aiding 3D design generation through visual quality
assessment of generated designs.
