## Exercise 1 (10 points)
Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It
supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or
Pinball (https://gym.openai.com/). Go through the Gym toolkit and explore different
environments available on the OpenAI.

Task in this exercise is to build a reinforcement learning algorithm based in the Q-
Learning explained in the lecture.
1. Read and familiarize yourself with the python file ‘q_learning.py’ provided
along with this homework.
2. Complete epsilon_greedy_policy method
This method should implement epsilon greedy policy explained in the lecture
slides. Use appropriate epsilon value for choosing optimal / random action.
3. Complete q_learning method
An empty Q-table has been created for your ease of use. Refer the Q-
Learning algorithm from the lecture slides and complete the q_learning
method to implement the same.
4. Explain the exploration-exploitation dilemma in Q-Learning. How is this
dilemma addressed? Explain.
5. What effect does the value of epsilon has on the Q-Learning? Explain the
effect of corner cases i.e. epsilon=1 and epsilon=0.
