# Data_Science\/Machine_learning_projects


Repository consists of various Machine learning,  Deeplearning (Neural Networks), Reinforcement learning , Data Science projects

The Projects involves solving various business problems ( eg: Predictive
Modeling,Customer-Segmentation etc.,) by collecting , preprocessing, exploring, visualizing,
analyzing data and applying various machine learning algorithms, Deep-
learning,Reinforcement Learning.

## Language: R, Python and its libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas,Tensorflow, Keras. 


Note: Most of the Solutions are presented in jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) 
Incase if you are unable to render jupyter notebook file using github (Example message: Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?) , 

A workaround:
Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"

Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/gopi-123/Data_Science-Machine_learning_projects/blob/master/3.Regression/Solution_Homework_2.ipynb"

This site nbviewer works independently of github.
